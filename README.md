Bullets
=======

npm install bulletswp

Bullets is a free WordPress skeleton theme. It contains just about enough Sass to get you started on your next project - but without being a highly comprehensive frame work such as Foundation or Bootstrap.

If you need a frame work with all the bells and whistles - Bullets is not the tool for you.

If you find yourself removing 80% of what comes with a frame work - give Bullets a try.

### Basic Docs

- Get started by tweaking the settings in settings.scss
- Go ahead and edit the partials directly - or if you want to leave them be - drop in your own Sass file structure. I recommend Aotmic Design approach which makes sense even for small scale projects.
- A basic grid is as simple as a row containing columns. Use the percent classes to control widths and the container class for a max width.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working

### Contribute

If you want to contribute - feel free. All pull requests considered. However, the aim of Bullets is to be light weight and skinny, so feature requests will always bare this in mind.
